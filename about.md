## About our Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

CityMesh aims to be a repository of easily re-usable models of cities around the world, aimed at enriching Architecture projects with Augmented Reality, stored on Github. Every model on here covered by the Creative Commons Attribution lisence, and you are free to reuse them however you wish, I would appreciate attribution, to allow other people to know where they can get models to use.
 
So far, all the models are obtained by using the OpenStreetMap data, and we provide information on how to generate your own models in the exact same way. 


### About The Author
<div class="box">
  <p>
    This resource has been put together by Adam Tomkins, a Computational Neuroscientist with a passion for Augmented reality and its many applications, as part of a self-driven project called AR and Architecture. You can find the original blog posts (here)[http://www.adamtomkins.github.io]. The aim of the project was to get those new to AR technology to get up to speed developing several basic projects, using free resources.
