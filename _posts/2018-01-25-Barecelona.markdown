#  Barcelona, The geometrical wonderland.

I recently stumbled across the absolutely engrossing blog by (Boluddha)[http://boluddha.com], which I encourage you to checkout. They have a great post, ('Such Great Heights')[http://boluddha.com/portfolio/such-great-heights/] that perfectly captures the geometrical regularity of such a picturesque city. 

Inspired by the stunning photography, I've put together a collection of meshes to recreate some of the shots. My only time in Barcelona was fleeting, spending most of my time in the (Museu Picasso)[www.museupicasso.bcn.cat/en/], making this a fun exploration of Barcelona from above, in to attempt to decipher the exact spot of each photograph.

## La Sagrada Familia and Sant Francesc de Sales 

This was a fun one to find, which covers Sant Francesc de Sales, the two city block images, as well as the central statue with aptly named Avinguada Diagonal ripping diagonally through the regular blocks, you can find it on Open Street Maps (here)[https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/41.39885/2.16987].

## La Vila Olympica

Found on Open Street Maps (Here)[https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/41.3864/2.1992], this mesh only details a small part of the area, covered in the photgraphs, as there were some export errors for larger views.

## Port Vell

I think there is a special place for ports in architecture, their blend of pure practicality, with their introductory role into a city, they stand in the perfect position for architectural innovation. You can find it on Open Street Maps (here)[https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=12/41.3262/2.1437], however the raw size of the land causes problems with exporting the OSM files.
